Implementation of ECCV2020 paper "Geometric Estimation via Robust Subspace Recovery"

This repo is now a rough version which only implements SRE-A in the paper, and will be improved soon. 

The method is renamed as EAS which is used in our journal version. 

If you find this code useful for your research, plese cite our paper "Geometric Estimation via Robust Subspace Recovery".

# usage

To use the code, run initialization.m first and run demo.m for simple examples.
