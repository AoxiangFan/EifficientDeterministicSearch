# EifficientDeterministicSearch

Implementation of ECCV 2020 paper "Geometric Estimation via Robust Subspace Recovery" and IEEE TPAMI 2021 paper "Efficient Deterministic Search with Robust Loss
Functions for Geometric Model Fitting". 

This repo is now a rough version which only implements EAS-A of the IEEE TPAMI 2021 paper (i.e. SRE-A in the ECCV 2020 paper) and will be improved soon with other proposed methods and a python implementation.
