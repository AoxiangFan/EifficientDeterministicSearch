Implementation of ECCV2020 paper "Geometric Estimation via Robust Subspace Recovery"

This repo is now a rough version which only implements SRE-A in the paper, and will be improved soon. 
The method is renamed as EAS which is used in our journal version.  

# usage
To use the code, run initialization.m first and run demo.m for simple examples.
